# Download From OSM

<https://www.openstreetmap.org/export#map=16/50.92856/4.33147>

![Export a custom area from OSM.](01_1_osm_export.jpg)


Data is exported as an "`.osm`" file.
It contains many geospatial objects which can be further processed.


# Cleanup in QGIS

## Import

- open qgis
- `Layer` >> `Add Layer` >> `Add Vector Layer` and import the osm file
- check attribute tables
  - Lines seem to be useful (trails/paths);
  - Points seem to be mixed box: some are habitat types, some are photo labels?
  - main info is in `Multipolygons`.
  
Select CRS:

![A CRS selection menu is hidden at the lower right information bar.](01_2_qgis_crs.jpg)


It might make sense to export and re-import the multipolygon layer to an open format with the right CRS and extent, to get good defaults for the following.


## Select by Expression

![You can select subsets of a data set by SQL expressions.](01_3_qgis_select_expression.jpg)

For example, select 

- `"name" IS NOT NULL`
- `"building" IS NOT NULL`
- `"natural" = 'water'`
- `"natural" IN ('water', 'wetland')`
- `"natural" = 'wood'`
- `AND`, `OR`, ... (SQL expressions)


Save selection:

- `Layer` >> `Save As` 
- toggle `Save only selected features`
- mind the **CRS** and **extent**

![When exporting a subset of features, make sure to select the correct CRS and extent.](01_4_save_layer_selection.jpg)
